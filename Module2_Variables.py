# int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.
# float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. growth_multiplier, with the value 1.1, is an example of a float.
# str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.
# bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False (the capitalization is important!).
